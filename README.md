Hello there!  👋
My name is Deeya, pronouns she/her, and my favorite color is purple 😛
I  am currently a fellow of the Cornell and BTT(Break through tech)  A.I. Program. I have experience with Python, Google Big Query, SQL, C,C++, Assembly. One of my projects is called Gather Up. This project was created during a school Hackathon called SparkHacks. It attempts to reinvent a website called when2meet which is an outdated way that our school clubs gather potential meeting times. This Project Utilizes Python, Fast API, and HTML. The second project in this github is the 8th lab of the Machine Learning Course, in which I used Census data and logistic regression to predict the sex-self-id column. The third project is what I spent the past semester working on with my group for a start up named Swytch Station. This project is a python RMSE and MAPE model that is trained on 60 months of aerospace employment data and predicts 3 months of data.
